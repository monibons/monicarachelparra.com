  <h2>JW Player Hackweek 2019 | Smol Dash</h2>
  <p>For JW Player's summer hackweek, our goal was to envision a "read-only" version of our publisher dashboard. Our desktop app has robust and complex workflows that we knew wouldn't translate well to a mobile experience so we turned our focus to providing insightful analytics.</p>
  <p>Completed in one week, our team include myself for design, a front-end engineer and a data scientist.</p>
