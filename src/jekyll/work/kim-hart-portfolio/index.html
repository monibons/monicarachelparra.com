  <h2>Kim Hart, Front-end Engineer | Portfolio</h2>
  <p>A front-end engineer should have a portfolio site and personal brand truly as badass as their talents which is genuinely what inspired the design and brand identity for kimhart.nyc.</p>
  <p>Born and raised in California but currently residing in Brooklyn, Kim's heart truly belongs to both coasts. My goal was to create a design that had both a West Coast vibe and a modern Brooklyn feel. Her love of music festivals is also where I drew inspiration for the concept of "Sun Up" to "Sun Down" as the theme for the overall site.</p>
