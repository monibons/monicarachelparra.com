        <h3>Hello! I'm Monica Parra, a Product Design Leader living outside of NYC in Hoboken, NJ.</h3>
        <p>I began my design career as a digital designer, working at publishing companies like <span>Newsweek</span> and <span>SPIN Magazine</span>, where my focus encompassed a blend of interactive storytelling and web design. I chose to pursue a focus in product design by leveraging my publishing background to join <span>Thomson Reuters</span>.</p>
            
        <p>Following my time there, collaborating with design technologists as well as designers, I made a pivot into the startup tech space. In between startup ventures, I completed a design fellowship with <span>Significance Labs</span>, contributing to a mobile app aimed at assisting lower-income families.</p>
            
        <p>While at my 2nd startup, <span>JW Player</span>, I made my transition into a leadership role as the Director of Product Design, building the design team and developing a homegrown design system. Most recently I joined <span>Mayo Clinic's</span> Center for Digital Health as a Product Design Lead.</p>
