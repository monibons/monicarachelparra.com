<div class="bio">
    <h3>Hello! I'm Monica Parra, a Product Designer from outside the greater New York City area of Hoboken, NJ.</h3>
    <p>I began my design career as a digital designer, working at publishing companies like Newsweek and SPIN Magazine, where my focus encompassed a blend of interactive storytelling and web design. I chose to pursue a focus in product design by leveraging my publishing background to join Thomson Reuters.</p>
        
    <p>Following my time there, collaborating with talented designers and design technologists, I made a pivot into the startup tech space. In between startup ventures, I completed a design fellowship with Significance Labs, contributing to a mobile app aimed at assisting lower-income families.</p>
        
    <p>While at my 2nd startup, JW Player, I made my transition into a leadership role as the Director of Product Design, building the design team and developing a homegrown design system. Most recently I joined Mayo Clinic's Center for Digital Health as a Product Design Lead.</p>
