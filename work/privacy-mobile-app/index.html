    <h2>Lithic's Privacy Mobile App</h2>
    <p>In response to customer feedback, Privacy undertook the first major update to its mobile app in years, aiming to enhance the user experience for our mobile users. The project involved rebuilding the app entirely from scratch to enable an improved user experience and drive higher conversion rates, usage, and volume.</p>
    <p>This redesign aligns with Privacy's mission to deliver excellent customer support and reflects how much we value our loyal and passionate user base.</p>
    <small>The new Privacy App is available today in the App Store for iOS and Google Play for Android.</small>
