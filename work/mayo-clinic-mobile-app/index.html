    <h2>Mayo Clinic Collaboration Mobile App</h2>
    <p>I joined Mayo Clinic's Center Digital Health as a Product Design lead for the Care Guidance product portfolio. Our objective was to deliver knowledge at the clinical point-of-care by empowering clinical teams through adaptable technical capabilities.</p>
    <p>This mobile app serves as a comprehensive platform that enables seamless communication and collaboration among Mayo Clinic physicians. </p>
