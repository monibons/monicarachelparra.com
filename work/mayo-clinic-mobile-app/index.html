    <h2>Mayo Clinic Collaboration Mobile App</h2>
    <p>I joined Mayo Clinic's Center for Digital Health (CDH) as the Product Design Lead for the Care Guidance product portfolio. Our mission was to deliver actionable knowledge at the clinical point of care by equipping care teams with adaptable, scalable digital tools.</p>
    <p>As part of this effort, we designed a mobile app that serves as a centralized platform to support seamless communication and collaboration among Mayo Clinic physicians.</p>
