    <div class="bio">
        <h3>Hello! I'm Monica Parra, a product designer living outside of NYC in Hoboken, NJ.</h3>
        <p>I began my design career as a digital designer, working at publishing companies such as <span>Newsweek</span> and <span>SPIN</span>, where my focus encompassed a blend of interactive storytelling and web design.</p>
        <p>Following my time there, I pivoted to product design working with startups. In between startup ventures, I completed a design fellowship with <span>Significance Labs</span>, building products to assist lower-income families. I enjoyed a long tenure as a design leader at <span>JW Player</span>, working in video tech, followed by a role at <span>Mayo Clinic</span> leading design for clinical systems. I am currently at <span>Lithic</span>, leading design for data privacy and digital wallets.</p>
